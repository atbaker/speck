# Speck

**Speck is an open-source, privacy-first local AI agent application.**

Speck is currently a proof-of-concept. This README will be expanded soon with instructions on how to run Speck yourself. In the meantime, if you have questions about Speck, [reach out to me and I'll be happy to connect with you](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewtorkbaker/).
